Q4 Describe the best project you have worked on, including links if any.

The best project that I have so far worked upon is related to a certain field that many people have started to head upon in
recent times across the whole world which is my Fitness App. Within this app, I worked upon the app so that I myself can get
back to fitness after the lockdown. With the functionality to choose exercise categories and specific muscle groups,
browse more than one thousand exercises with practical examples, pagination, exercise details, pull related videos from youtube,
display similar exercises, and much more. With the youth especially growing to have certain interests among the
exercising, this app will surely help them to achieve the best results in which they can pursue their future.
For this project I used HTML5, CSS3, React.js, APIâ€™s, Node.Js and Material UI.
