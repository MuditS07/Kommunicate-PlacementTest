Q5 If you are to start a software company, name 2 people from your batch whom you will choose as your partner and why?

If I was to start a new software company, I would like to choose 2 of my close friends as partners naming,
Danishwaran S (RA1911003030095) & Ritvik Soni (RA1911003030070), because Danishwaran is pretty much superior and
knowledgeable towards the software field so by that means he will be quite helpful to build and start-up the
company whereas Ritvik being a pretty good technical guy and being close friends our teamwork might help the company to avoid difficulties in the start of the Organisation.
